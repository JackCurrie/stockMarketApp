# Stock MarketApp
Ionic tutorial app, first app!
Simple app built to draw data from the yahoo finance API, and format it in a consumable manner.

# Motivation
I mainly worked on this app in order to familiarize myself with the ionic framework.

At the time I made this, it was my first dive into mobile development, and I had little experience with web development either.
Because of this, I was still learning to understand what parts of the application were angular-based, and which were ionic.
Also, I didn't really understand how to use git at the time when I first started with it, so this repo is somewhat of a mess all around.

Regardless, it was a great opportunity to learn.

This was based off of the ionic tutorial from the udemy course "Rapid prototyping with Ionic: Build a data driven Mobie Application" by Hunter Leaman.

I would recommend this course highly to anybody trying to learn Ionic 1 who has some web development experience, though it seems as if Ionic 1 is quickly becoming a thing of the past!
